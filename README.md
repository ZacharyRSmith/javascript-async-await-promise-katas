#### Overview

## Overview

Katas with tests for exercising JavaScript async stuff.

Git clone, npm install, then make the tests pass by filling in the implementation in index.js.

Try solving using async/await, then without.

Try solving with as readable a solution as possible, or as performant.

Or whatever.

Methods are inspired by [the async lib](https://caolan.github.io/async/docs.html).
